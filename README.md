# Automatic-Posture-Detection-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
• Developed a prototype system for real-time posture monitoring and adjustment in autonomous vehicles using MPU6050 sensors and Raspberry Pi 4.

• Integrated six-axis motion sensors with microcontroller for detecting roll, pitch, and yaw in real-time.

• Built a 3D-printed car model equipped with sensors and actuators for dynamic testing and simulation.

• Achieved 95% posture detection accuracy, ensuring stable and responsive vehicle performance in dynamic environments.

• Collaborated with a team of 2 members.

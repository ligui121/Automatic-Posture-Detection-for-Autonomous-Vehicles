# 🚗 ESE 525 Project — Automatic Posture Detection using MPU6050 in a Demo Car

This project demonstrates the application of the **MPU6050** sensor for **real-time posture detection** in an autonomous vehicle prototype. Built as part of the **ESE 525: Modern Sensors in AI Applications** course at Stony Brook University, this system integrates **accelerometer** and **gyroscope** data to monitor and adjust the vehicle's orientation in real time.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and build a demo car equipped with an MPU6050 sensor for detecting roll, pitch, and yaw. The system utilizes a **Raspberry Pi 4**, an **L298N motor driver**, and a **buzzer** for alert signaling. Sensor readings are processed to dynamically adjust the car’s orientation during operation.

Key features:

- Real-time attitude estimation using sensor fusion
- Edge computing on Raspberry Pi
- Low-cost, power-efficient design
- 3D-printed chassis for prototyping
